 I came across one reddit post which mentioned that Modi script has unicode characters. I got thinking and i couldnt find any tool that converts devanagari to modi script. 

 There was one tool called [AksharkMukh](https://www.aksharamukha.com/input/Modi), which could be a great (and maybe superior) tool, but i feel this webpage is more layman friendly. 

I have to acknowledge that the beautification with the html is not totally written by me. I made a crappy looking html with web-python. I used claude to beautify it. And it really did magic over there. 

While doing the mappings from devanagari to modi,following resources were really helpful. 

1. The official Unicode mappings -> https://www.unicode.org/charts/PDF/U11600.pdf
2. [Typography and Culture](https://www.typoday.in/2014/spk_papers14/rajendrathakre-typo14.pdf) by Rajendra Thakre.


If any errors, feel free to reach out on github issues of this repository or mail me at f20190041g@alumni.bits-pilani.ac.in. 

Thanks.
